## What is SaqueroJobs?

SaqueroJobs is a production-style background job processing engine built with **.NET 8**.

It simulates how real enterprise platforms handle background work: defining jobs, triggering executions, tracking lifecycle states, logging execution steps, and retrying failures — all with clean architecture and a professional API surface.

This is not a CRUD. It is a backend engine that demonstrates real system design thinking.

## Key Design Decisions

**JobDefinition and JobExecution are separate aggregates.** Defining a job and running it are different concepts. A JobDefinition is a template — it holds the type, retry policy, cron expression and enabled state. A JobExecution is a record of one run — it owns its lifecycle, its logs, its attempt number.

**RetryPolicy is a Value Object.** It is not a pair of loose fields. It is a domain concept with its own invariants, embedded directly in the JobDefinition aggregate.

**ExecutionStatus has 7 states.** Pending → Running → Completed / Failed / TimedOut / Cancelled / Retrying. State transitions are enforced by the domain — invalid transitions throw JobDomainException.

**Handlers are registered by JobType string.** JobHandlerRegistry resolves the correct IJobHandler at runtime. Adding a new job type requires only a new handler class — no changes to the engine.

**The scheduler is a HostedService.** It polls every 15 seconds for Pending and Retrying executions, resolves their handler, runs them, and updates status. It never crashes the host — all errors are caught per-execution.
